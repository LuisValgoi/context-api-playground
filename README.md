# Objective

This project was created to better understande the usage of ContextAPI and how it can solve the prop drilling problem.

It was created following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsCBw9X9U84&ab_channel=GuilhermeRodz) tutorial.

# App

The idea is to have two main components: `Counter` and `Mirror`.

The `Mirror` one, would basically mirror the behavior and the state managed by the `Counter`.
